## Alternative Implementation

This dashboard can be recreated using modern Python tools:

### Plotly Implementation
```python
import plotly.graph_objects as go
from plotly.subplots import make_subplots

# Create interactive dashboard
fig = make_subplots(
    rows=3, cols=2,
    specs=[[{"type": "scatter"}, {"type": "pie"}],
           [{"type": "scatter"}, {"type": "bar"}],
           [{"colspan": 2}, None]],
    subplot_titles=("Portfolio Timeline", "Asset Allocation",
                   "Performance Index", "Monthly Analysis",
                   "Technical Indicators")
)
```

### Streamlit Alternative
```python
import streamlit as st
import plotly.express as px

# Create interactive components
st.title("Investment Dashboard")
date_range = st.date_input("Select Date Range")
selected_assets = st.multiselect("Select Assets")

# Dynamic visualizations
col1, col2 = st.columns(2)
with col1:
    st.plotly_chart(timeline_chart)
with col2:
    st.plotly_chart(allocation_chart)
```
